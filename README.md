## Mission

To provide users with a data source that will help identify and locate a Martial Arts dojo that best meets their needs.

---

The purpose of this project is to create an application for users to find martial art schools near them. This is for those that are interested in martial arts and would like to find one in their area.

Do you want to learn how to fight but don’t know where to start? There’s dojos all around you but you have no idea what they teach and which style of fighting is right for you. That’s where we come in. You can either start by browsing the styles above to learn which one will best serve your interests or search your address below to see what is offered in your area.</p>
    <p>Wherever you are in your search we can help. So pick a style or search your location, either way congrats on taking the first step to start kicking ass and taking names.</p>
