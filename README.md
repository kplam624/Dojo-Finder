## Background

---
There may be a lot of important and useful data available these days, but it is often dispersed among multiple data sources and not well organized. Extracting the data from its sources, transforming it by cleaning or reformatting it, and loading or storing the resulting data into a well designed database is a critical process for data-driven organization. Presenting the associated data visualizations in a well defined and organized web site for users makes it even more meaningful. 

## Mission

---

To provide users with a data source that will help identify and locate a Martial Arts dojo that best meets their needs. 

Our focus for Version 1 is limited to the state of New Jersey, with the potential that future versions can expand to more states as desired.
