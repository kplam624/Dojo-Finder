# Dojo-Finder


## Background

---
There may be a lot of important and useful data available regarding Martial Arts these days, but it is often dispersed among multiple data sources and not well organized. Extracting the data from its sources, transforming it by cleaning or reformatting it, and loading or storing the resulting data into a well designed database is a critical process for data-driven organizations. 

Presenting the associated data visualizations in a well defined and organized website for users who are looking for a nearby Dojo makes this process even more meaningful and effective. 

## Mission

---

To provide users with a data source that will help identify and locate a Martial Arts dojo that best meets their needs. 

The focus for our first website version is limited to the state of New Jersey, with the potential that future versions can expand to more states within the United States as desired. 

## Let's Get Started! 

---

Do you want to learn how to fight and defend yourself but donâ€™t know where to start? - you've come to the right place!! 

As the purpose of these efforts is to create an application for users to find a Martial Arts school near them, or at a preferred location, this site will help unlock the secret "code" of Martial Arts for both beginners and continuing Martial Arts students.

For those looking to learn more about the different styles and types of Martial Arts available in search of dojos to support their interests, just navigate to our "Sunburst" of knowledge on the "Home" page. This visual tool will provide the user with more info on the various techniques such as Strikes (punching, kicking),  Grappling (throwing, pinning), Hybrid, etc, with the option to further refine browsing with more subtopics and decriptions of each Martial Arts type as selected by the user.  

The user can also just jump right in by searching with their preferred location details to determine the nearest or desired Dojo. The search result will take them to the "Map" Page for them to visually confirm or further refine their search results. 

The "Data" Page also hosts the compilation of Dojos in New Jersey with its respective details so the user can choose another method to filter the data requested.
