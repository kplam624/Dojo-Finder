Topic: Martial Arts Dojos

Purpose: With the times that we live in, self defense seems to be more important than ever.

What better way to defend your self than using your own body.

This site is for people who would like to learn self defense. Giving the user knowledge about the specific style
and the nearest dojo.

Process:

1. Webscrape using beautifulsoup the following website: https://dojos.info/NewJersey/Counties.aspx
2. With the data scraped create a database(sql?) and upload the clean dataframe to it.
3. Create webpages to fit our needs.
4. Deploy

Format:

* Homepage: A legend view that describes the martial arts styles, what each style is and describes them(grappling,striking, etc.)
* A map with different locations and martial arts dojos and schools(rat example), with tool tips.
* A form for the user to enter their info to find the closest school.

Inspirations:
